## Introduction

The Monty ByteCode Interpreter is a project aimed at creating an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files. Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes, similar to Python. It relies on a unique stack with specific instructions to manipulate it. This project focuses on implementing these instructions in C, allowing users to execute Monty scripts.

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing a series of tasks related to stack and queue operations in the Monty scripting language. Each task corresponds to a specific opcode that needs to be implemented. These opcodes include push, pall, pint, pop, swap, add, nop, sub, div, mul, mod, comments, pchar, pstr, rotl, rotr, stack, and queue.

## Project Background

This project is part of the group projects assigned during the ALX Software Engineering program.

## Prerequisites

To use the Monty ByteCode Interpreter, you will need:

- A C compiler (gcc recommended)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or a compatible environment
- Basic knowledge of the Monty scripting language and its opcodes

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone the Monty ByteCode Interpreter repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-aishah/monty.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd monty
```

3. Compile the code using the provided compilation command:
